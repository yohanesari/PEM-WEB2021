                    <p>I fell by the wayside, like everyone else<br>
                        I hate you, I hate you, I hate you<br>
                        But I was just kidding myself<br>
                        Our every moment, I start to replace<br>
                        'Cause now that they're gone<br>
                        All I hear are the words that I needed to say<br>
                        When you hurt under the surface<br>
                        Like troubled water running cold<br>
                        Well, time can heal, but this won't<br><span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">
                        So, before you go<br>
                        Was there something I could've said<br>
                        To make your heart beat better?<br>
                        If only I'd have known you had a storm to weather<br>
                        So, before you go<br>
                        Was there something I could've said<br>
                        To make it all stop hurting?<br>
                        It kills me how your mind can make you feel so worthless<br>
                        So, before you go<br>
                        Was never the right time, whenever you called<br>
                        Went little, by little, by little until there was nothing at all<br>
                        Our every moment, I start to replay<br>
                        But all I can think about is seeing that look on your face<br>
                        When you hurt under the surface<br>
                        Like troubled water running cold<br>
                        Well, time can heal, but this won't<br>

                        So, before you go<br>
                        Would we be better off by now<br>
                        If I'd let my walls come down?<br>
                        Maybe I guess we'll never know<br>
                        You know, you know<br>
                        Before you go<br>
